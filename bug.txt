Bug #1 = I noticed a bug that seems to affect the color of the buttons and and selected tab where it turns from the stndard crimson red we have to like a washed out pink. It seems to happen at random times when the application is open. Can you please check the applicatioon and make sure this will not be a problem when deployed to internet on chrome. I just noticed this issue only on google chrome not local. Also it even appears the rest of the pages are washed out to like the icons for on the reports page for example. It seems to be all the colors. I didn't notice this issue when accessing the site with edge. 

Bug #2 = On the scorecard page, where it says rank and lists all the numbers like 1, 2, 3 it isnt centered aligned to the rank column so the number is to the left and it looks off. Can you please fix this.

Bug #3 = When the application is opended on the web, in the actual tab in the browser at the top, it displays the vite+react logo next to the words time-and-attendance-tracker. Instead I wanted it the vite+react logo to be replaced with something more aesteically pleaseing and then for the tite of the tab in the browser, can we make it just say T&ATracker

Bug #4 = I found another bug in the application. The starting points balance, when the number is updated in the general configuration page in the settings tab and is updated to like 100 for example, when it should change the logic of the applicationn to change everyones starting points to the new updated number and calcuate the scores accordingly. Can you make this functionality is in the application. 



Please update the login credential page when landing on the page to dark mode so it easier to see. Right now the page looks good just the white is blinding.

On the scorecard page I want there to be a qaurter selector so we can use the selector to select the specfic quarter we want to see and it will display the scorecard for that quarter. It should default to the current quarter.



1. When archiving an employee on the employees page, they get added back into the active employees list instead of staying hidden in the archive menu. With that said, when an employee is archived, their attendance violations or name should not be included in the reports on the reports page or in the stats on any page because they were terminated. Please adjust this. 

2. On the dashboard after you login, it has the terminations dashboard element on there which is what I want but when employees are archived it is not counting them as terminations. The termination counter needs to count up when employees are terminated. Please inspect this elemnt to make sure it is behvaing correctly.

3. When multiple users are given access to the platform and I am using spuabase for back end storage, when we all login we have access to different accounts and our data isnt shared across users. Now this is a problem because each user has their own data. I want all the data to be merged between all users so whether I login or my team member logs in we all see the same data.

4. We need to add more things for the log violation page and I mean more violations type. For example, if an employee shows up early, they should recieve plus 1 point to their attendance score. If an employee picks up a shift they should recieve +5 points to their attendance score. So we need to add early arrival and shift pickup to the violation type so we can start loggin those. We also need to add this to the points calcuation logic so it calcuates the score correctly. I also want these values it adds to their score to be editable in the settings page under the violations penatly so I can edit the amount of points for these scenarios. 

5. I want to ensure the following logic is incorporated into our current point system calcuation. 
### Bonus Point Opportunities
Monthly Bonus Potential:
- Perfect Attendance: +10 points
 - No callouts for entire month
 - No tardiness for entire month

Maximum Quarterly Bonus: 45 points

### Quarter-to-Quarter Progression Rules
#### Starting Balance Determination
1. Good Standing (125+ points at quarter end):
 - Next quarter starts at 150 points
 - Clean slate for infractions
2. Coaching DA (85-124 points at quarter end):
 - Next quarter starts at 125 points
 - Can earn bonus points up to 140 points
3. Severe DA (50-84 points at quarter end):
 - Next quarter starts at 100 points
 - Can earn bonus points up to 115 points
4. Final DA (1-49 points at quarter end):
 - Next quarter starts at 75 points
 - Can earn bonus points up to 90 points
### Progression and Recovery Rules
#### Upward Movement
- If an employee maintains points above the next lower threshold for an entire quarter, they 
move up one level
- Example: An employee on Severe DA (starting at 100 points) stays above the Final DA 
threshold (50 points) for the entire quarter will move to Coaching DA in the next quarter
#### Downward Movement
- Occurs immediately when point threshold is crossed
- No grace period for recovery within the same quarter
#### Bonus Point Impact
- Can help accelerate recovery through perfect attendance
- Cannot skip multiple levels regardless of bonus points earned
- Bonus points can affect next quarter's starting balance (up to 15 points)
### Bonus Point Calculation Example
Quarter Performance Scenario:
- Month 1: Perfect attendance (+10), No tardiness (+5)
- Month 2: Perfect attendance (+10)
- Month 3: Perfect attendance (+10), No tardiness (+5)
- Total bonus earned: 40 points
Next Quarter Starting Balance Calculation:
- Base Points: Determined by previous quarter's ending status
- Bonus Points: Capped at 15 points
- Final Starting Balance: Base points + capped bonus points
### Key Considerations
- Points cannot exceed 150 at any time
