Bug #1 = I noticed a bug that seems to affect the color of the buttons and and selected tab where it turns from the stndard crimson red we have to like a washed out pink. It seems to happen at random times when the application is open. Can you please check the applicatioon and make sure this will not be a problem when deployed to internet on chrome. I just noticed this issue only on google chrome not local. Also it even appears the rest of the pages are washed out to like the icons for on the reports page for example. It seems to be all the colors. I didn't notice this issue when accessing the site with edge. 

Bug #2 = On the scorecard page, where it says rank and lists all the numbers like 1, 2, 3 it isnt centered aligned to the rank column so the number is to the left and it looks off. Can you please fix this.

Bug #3 = When the application is opended on the web, in the actual tab in the browser at the top, it displays the vite+react logo next to the words time-and-attendance-tracker. Instead I wanted it the vite+react logo to be replaced with something more aesteically pleaseing and then for the tite of the tab in the browser, can we make it just say T&ATracker

Bug #4 = I found another bug in the application. The starting points balance, when the number is updated in the general configuration page in the settings tab and is updated to like 100 for example, when it should change the logic of the applicationn to change everyones starting points to the new updated number and calcuate the scores accordingly. Can you make this functionality is in the application.
